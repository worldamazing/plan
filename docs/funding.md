# Step 2: Funding World Amazing: The Core Fund, Beyond the Core Fund, and Governance


## Empowering Humanity and Removing Barriers to Wealth
The Global Institution (GI) envisions a world where every individual has the freedom and resources to thrive. By reimagining wealth and removing traditional barriers to financial success, the GI empowers humanity to achieve extraordinary growth, innovation, and connection.

Through its framework, the GI provides:
- **Freedom from Financial Insecurity:** With essentials like housing, healthcare, and education guaranteed, members are liberated from the burdens of scarcity. This allows them to focus their energy on creativity, collaboration, and personal growth, fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship that benefits the entire community.
- **Opportunities for Innovation and Enterprise:** The GI’s two-day workweek creates time and space for members to engage in or initiate projects that align with their passions and values. These endeavors, while not primarily profit-driven, have the potential to generate revenue, enhancing members’ financial well-being and supporting the institution’s initiatives. This dynamic environment nurtures creativity, collaboration, and entrepreneurship.
- **A Redefined Concept of Wealth:** The GI reimagines wealth as a tool for collective progress, dismantling old paradigms of exclusivity and inequality. Members can ethically accumulate financial resources, knowing their success contributes to both personal prosperity and the greater good. By encouraging all members to build wealth through meaningful contributions, the GI ensures that financial success is accessible to all, fostering a community where resources are used ethically to support inclusivity, sustainability, and global improvement.


## Funding and Spending the Core Fund
This vision of empowerment is made possible by the GI's innovative funding structure, which lays the groundwork for universal prosperity through collective contributions and shared governance.

The GI framework is designed to mobilize significant resources by engaging at least one billion people, about 10% of the population, to contribute a core membership investment of $25,000 each. This $25 trillion fund will lay the foundation for a future free from bills and taxes for essentials like housing, healthcare, education, and food, ensuring universal prosperity. This investment is not a fee but a shared commitment to building a sustainable, equitable, and thriving global community.

- **Transparent and Controlled Contributions**: Every contribution is placed into a personal fund under the member’s control, ensuring fully transparent and democratic spending decisions. The funds will be used solely to acquire resources, build infrastructure, and create self-sustaining communities, with no portion allocated to personal salaries or private enrichment. From the $25 trillion fund, 4%, or $1 trillion annually, or $1000 per person from the $25,000 investment, will sustain operations and projects from 2025 to 2050, providing ample time to establish and expand the GI’s framework. This substantial budget will be primarily allocated to acquiring land and resources, essential for building a self-sufficient infrastructure and laying the groundwork for a globally integrated community.
- **Inclusivity Through Earned Membership**: The goal is for all members, not just 10% of the world population, to have a core fund of $25,000 under their control. For those unable to pay upfront, membership can be earned through multi-year investment plans, scholarships recognizing past contributions to society, or additional work commitments within the GI. With members working an average of just two days a week, these commitments can be fulfilled quickly, ensuring everyone can meet their core fund investment. This approach removes financial barriers, enabling full participation in allocating core funds toward projects and guaranteeing all members an equal voice in governance and decision-making.
- **Scaling the GI’s Impact**: With every member of humanity joining the GI and having $25,000 in their core fund, the GI’s capacity for global impact grows exponentially. This would allow the GI to increase its yearly spending from $1 trillion annually to nearly $10 trillion annually, expanding its ability to address humanity’s most pressing needs and foster innovation on a global scale.


## Governance of the Core Fund
A robust governance framework ensures that every decision reflects the values of transparency, inclusivity, and collective well-being.
- **Member-Controlled Financial Contributions**: Upon joining, each member's contribution is deposited into a personal account, akin to a savings account, where control over these funds remains legally with the member. This ensures that all spending decisions require member approval, embodying a democratic and transparent process where your money is your vote, and each dollar remains under your legal control indefinitely. 
- **Ethical and Strategic Use of Funds**: No part of the core fund will be used for salaries or personal enrichment. All collected funds are dedicated to acquiring land and resources necessary for providing goods and services to all members. This approach ensures that the GI core fund operates on a non-profit basis, focusing solely on enhancing the community's collective well-being.
- **Democratic Decision-Making and Resource Allocation**: Every member is given the opportunity to influence how funds are allocated. This democratic approach ensures that everyone has a seat at the decision-making table. Members can persuade others on the best uses of the core fund, promoting a culture of active participation and shared governance.


## Beyond the Core Fund: Personal and Project Funds
Members have the opportunity to grow their personal funds by engaging in or starting projects within the GI. This system encourages innovation, creativity, and collaborative entrepreneurship while aligning personal success with the broader goals of the GI.

While no member will require a salary or additional personal funds to cover essential living costs, since these are provided by the institution, the ability to earn through contributions to institution projects ensures that members can achieve financial growth and personal development within the GI framework.

### Higher Membership Levels
The GI framework introduces a tiered membership system designed to recognize various forms of member contributions. Members can ascend to higher levels through one of three ways: direct financial contributions, revenue from successful GI projects, or recognition for exceptional non-financial contributions.

Each level signifies a deeper engagement with and contribution to the GI, carrying perks and increased financial influence within the community. The specifics of the benefits associated with each tier will be developed collaboratively within the GI community, ensuring they reflect the collective values and goals of all members.

The proposed levels include:
- **$100,000**
- **$1 million**
- **$10 million**
- **$100 million**
- **$1 billion**
- **$10 billion**
- **$100 billion**
- **Beyond $100 billion**

### Pathways to Higher Membership Levels
Members can achieve higher tiers through one of three primary pathways:

1. **Direct Financial Contributions:** Members can achieve higher membership levels by directly investing amounts that correspond to specific tiers. For example, by investing $100,000, a member qualifies for the corresponding membership level. This investment grants them the ability to personally spend an equivalent amount ($100,000) in the GI marketplace. Due to the GI's operational efficiencies and the unique economic model, spending within the GI marketplace will offer a higher value compared to traditional markets. This means that the $100,000 spent in the GI marketplace could have the purchasing power equivalent to a significantly higher amount in a conventional market, effectively doubling or even tripling the value of their spending. Thus, their initial financial contribution not only supports the GI’s projects and initiatives but also retains substantial value for personal use within the ecosystem, preserving and likely enhancing their purchasing power.

2. **Revenue from GI Projects:** Members can achieve higher membership levels by leading or significantly contributing to projects that generate revenue within the GI. For instance, to reach the $100,000 tier, a member would need their project to generate a net profit of $200,000. This profit is then divided equally, with $100,000 going into the member's GI project fund, which they directly control and can use to fund future projects or initiatives. The other $100,000 is credited to their personal salary fund, available for use within the GI marketplace or for personal saving. This structure rewards members for successful project outcomes and enhances their financial influence within the GI.

3. **Recognition for Outstanding Contributions:** Members who make significant non-financial contributions, such as exceptional community service, innovation, or leadership, can be elevated to higher membership levels in recognition of their efforts. For instance, if a member's contributions are deemed extraordinary enough to warrant elevation to the $100,000 level, they will be awarded $100,000 for their personal project fund and an additional $100,000 in their salary fund. This acknowledgment ensures that invaluable contributions of skills, expertise, and leadership are rewarded equivalently to financial investments, empowering these members to have a greater impact within the GI while enjoying enhanced benefits in the GI marketplace.

### Benefits of Higher Levels
- **Enhanced Economic Impact**: The influx of funds from these higher tiers significantly expands the GI's financial capabilities, enabling a broader range of ambitious projects and infrastructure developments. This additional capital ensures that the GI can pursue large-scale endeavors that might be beyond the scope of the initial core fund, from advanced technological research to expansive ecological restoration projects.
- **Strategic Goal: Transition to GI Economy**: The ultimate objective of introducing these tiers is to encourage the transition of personal, corporate, and institutional funds from traditional economies into the GI economy. By offering superior value and impact per dollar spent within the GI marketplace, the framework aims to render traditional economic systems obsolete. This shift not only consolidates the GI's economic base but also aligns global financial resources with sustainable and equitable growth, making the GI a central hub for future economic activity worldwide.
- **Broadening the GI's Impact**: With these additional resources, the GI can extend its influence and capabilities, funding a wide array of projects that can have transformative effects on both local and global scales. This not only furthers the GI's mission but also attracts further investments and projects, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and innovation.


## Conclusion: From Scarcity to Abundance
The Global Institution represents a bold new vision for humanity: one that replaces systems of scarcity, competition, and inequality with abundance, cooperation, and shared prosperity.

By reimagining the foundations of our economic and social structures, the GI offers a pathway to a future where everyone can thrive. Through transparent funding, inclusive membership, and innovative governance, the GI empowers individuals and communities alike to contribute to and benefit from a truly amazing world.

Together, we can make this vision a reality not in the distant future, but now.
