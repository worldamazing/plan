# World Amazing: Comprehensive Benefits for a Thriving Society

By creating the Global Institution (GI), these changes will naturally unfold over time, providing comprehensive benefits for all and leading to the eradication of crime and societal issues.



## Covered For All
The GI is committed to ensuring that every member has access to the essential services and resources needed for a healthy, fulfilling life. From housing and healthcare to education and transportation, these services will be provided at no additional cost to all active members. By removing financial barriers to these basic needs, the GI aims to create a society where people can focus on personal growth, creativity, and community without the stress of securing essential services. This comprehensive coverage is designed to promote well-being, equity, and opportunity for everyone.

1. **Housing**: Including utilities (electricity, water, heating, cooling).

## Obsolete For All
The GI envisions a future where outdated and exploitative systems, such as profit-driven services that do not contribute to the GI and its members, traditional governance structures, and privatized essential resources, are no longer needed. By establishing a community-driven, resource-based economy that prioritizes human well-being over profit, the GI will make these obsolete systems irrelevant. Through cooperative management, sustainable practices, and equitable distribution of resources, members will no longer rely on systems that perpetuate inequality, financial stress, or environmental harm. In their place, new structures will foster collaboration, shared prosperity, and security for all.

1. **Insurance Services**: Traditional for-profit health, life, property, and liability insurance systems will no longer be needed, as all risks and essential services will be managed and provided for within the GI's inclusive framework, ensuring universal coverage without the need for profit-based insurance.
1. **Commercial Banking**: Traditional banking services with fees and interest will be replaced by community-centered, fee-free financial systems that prioritize equitable access to capital and financial management for all members.
1. **Non-Essential Corporations**: Companies, including for-profit education institutions, that do not provide essential services to humanity will be phased out, as the GI will focus solely on organizations that contribute directly to the well-being and advancement of society, replacing profit-driven models with purpose-driven missions.
1. **Private Ownership of Essential Utilities**: Individual and for-profit ownership of essential resources such as water and energy will no longer exist. These utilities will be collectively managed by the community, ensuring equitable, sustainable, and affordable access for all members while eliminating the potential for exploitation or scarcity.
1. **Charities and NGOs**: Non-profits and NGOs that provide basic services will become obsolete, as the GI will ensure that all essential services—such as food, shelter, and healthcare—are universally available without the need for external charitable intervention.
1. **Debt**: Personal and corporate debt structures will be eliminated, as the GI’s economic model will provide what is needed for all, without the necessity of borrowing or accumulating interest-bearing debt.
1. **Taxation**: Traditional forms of taxation to fund government services will be obsolete, as the GI will manage all essential services through collective contributions and sustainable resource management, eliminating the need for taxes.
1. **Landlords and Rental Markets**: Private ownership of rental properties will be unnecessary, as the GI will ensure that everyone has access to equitable, comfortable housing without the need for for-profit rental markets.
1. **Legal Services**: Traditional for-profit legal services will no longer be required, as all legal matters will be handled within the GI framework, providing equitable access to conflict resolution, mediation, and justice for all members.
1. **Private Transport Services**: For-profit transportation services will be replaced by public and community-based transport systems that prioritize sustainability, accessibility, and affordability for all members.
1. **Commercial Agriculture**: Large-scale, for-profit farming operations will be replaced by sustainable, community-supported agriculture that focuses on local food production, equitable distribution, and environmental stewardship.
1. **Commercial Entertainment**: For-profit entertainment companies will be replaced by community-driven, culturally enriching entertainment and recreational services accessible to all members.
1. **Commercial Environmental Services**: For-profit waste management and recycling companies will be replaced by integrated, sustainable waste and environmental services managed collectively for the benefit of the planet and all communities.
1. **Traditional Government Structures**: National, state, and local governments as separate entities will no longer be required, as the GI will implement a unified governance model that transcends borders and eliminates the need for taxation-based funding.



## Societal Issues Cured For All
By addressing the root causes of systemic inequality, resource mismanagement, and environmental degradation, the GI aims to create conditions where these societal issues can no longer thrive. Through equitable distribution of resources, universal access to education and healthcare, and sustainable environmental practices, the GI will work to eliminate the foundational conditions that perpetuate these problems. The result is a healthier, more just society where everyone can prosper without fear of scarcity, inequality, or systemic failure.

1. **Economic Inequality**: Reduced by equitable access to resources and opportunities.
1. **Educational Disparities**: Eliminated through universal access to quality education for all.
1. **Environmental Degradation**: Addressed by sustainable resource management and practices.
1. **Resource Depletion**: Prevented through balanced and sustainable use of resources.
1. **Drug and Substance Abuse**: Addressed with robust healthcare and mental wellness support integrated into daily life.
1. **Hunger and Malnutrition**: Eliminated through community-supported agriculture, food programs, and universal access to nutritious food for all members.
1. **Illiteracy**: Tackled through universal access to education at all levels.
1. **Digital Divide**: Closed with universal access to technology and communication services.
1. **Housing Instability**: Solved by providing housing for all members, but more importantly, by eliminating the conditions that lead to housing insecurity in the first place.
1. **Lifestyle-Related Diseases**: Prevented through healthcare, education, and the creation of a world where stress, inequality, and other systemic pressures are eliminated. This includes conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and many types of cancers, which are influenced by factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The GI’s holistic approach ensures that everyone lives in an environment that supports healthy choices, reduces stress, and removes the societal pressures that often lead to lifestyle diseases in the first place.
1. **Infectious Diseases**: Reduced through comprehensive healthcare and preventative measures. In the event of viral outbreaks, the GI’s framework would allow people to stay home for extended periods without any disruption to their well-being or the economy. This could lead to the eradication of certain viruses—like the flu or coronaviruses—without the need for vaccines, as community-wide isolation would prevent their spread. With universal support for all members, the GI can eliminate the conditions that force people to work while sick, ensuring swift containment and recovery.



## Crimes Eliminated For All
The GI will work to eradicate crime by addressing its root causes—such as poverty, inequality, lack of education, and social isolation—through holistic societal transformation. By ensuring that all individuals have access to essential resources, education, and opportunities for personal growth, the GI aims to create a society where the motivations for crime diminish over time. Rather than focusing on punishment, the GI emphasizes prevention, rehabilitation, and community-building to create a safer, more harmonious world for everyone.

1. **Violence and Aggression**: Encompassing murder, assault, abuse, and torture, the GI will focus on reducing interpersonal and systemic violence by addressing inequality, mental health, and social isolation, fostering a peaceful and supportive society.
1. **War and Armed Conflict**: Prevented through international collaboration, resource-sharing, and peaceful conflict resolution, eliminating the need for nationalistic or resource-driven wars.
1. **Exploitation and Human Trafficking**: Addressing the root causes of human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation through equal access to opportunities, resources, and protection for vulnerable populations.
1. **Corruption and Abuse of Power**: Eliminated through transparency, shared governance, and removing profit-driven motivations from leadership structures, ensuring integrity at all levels.
1. **Discrimination and Inequality**: Encompassing systemic discrimination, such as racism, sexism, and other forms of bias, addressed through education, inclusivity, and equal access to resources.
1. **Forced Displacement**: Prevented by ensuring equitable access to housing, resources, and community stability, removing the conditions that lead to displacement due to conflict, disaster, or economic hardship.
