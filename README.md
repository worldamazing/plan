## The Promise: The Great Relief
The goal of this plan is not just "world peace." It is **Relief**. It is the systematic removal of the background noise of anxiety—financial, physical, and psychological—that defines modern life.


## Key Highlights
* **Time Sovereignty:** A shift from "earning a living" to "living a life." By removing the 80% of economic activity that is waste, administration, or extraction, we secure a high standard of living with just **2 days of meaningful contribution per week**. The rest of your time is yours. *While the initial transition will require focused effort to build our new infrastructure, the long-term trajectory uses advanced automation to steadily reduce this requirement, aiming for a future where mandatory labor approaches zero.*
* **The Dual Economy:** We separate survival from commerce. Essentials (housing, healthcare, education, food) are guaranteed rights within the **Foundational Economy**, while a vibrant **Marketplace Economy** allows for the free trade of goods, services, and creative projects.
* **Lifecycle Capitalization:** Replaces the "monthly treadmill" of rent, premiums, and taxes with a **single, one-time capitalization**. A contribution of $25,000 (paid or earned through sweat equity) secures your place in the commons for life.
* **True Home Ownership:** You are not a tenant to a landlord or a debtor to a bank. You are the sovereign steward of your home. It is yours to live in, improve, and enjoy, completely free from the threat of foreclosure, rent hikes, or eviction.
* **Governance by Clarity:** We replace "Rulers" with "Structure." Decisions are made through a transparent, decentralized network of **Clarity Nodes** and local consensus, prioritizing truth over power.
* **The Obsolescence Strategy:** We do not fight the old system. We simply build a new one so effective, so humane, and so efficient that the old system becomes obsolete.
* **Radical Creative Freedom:** With survival guaranteed and time abundant, you have the space, resources, and support to **build anything you can imagine**—from art to industry.
* **The End of Systemic Distortion:** A commitment to healing the "Primal Bug" of Civilization 1.0. We foster a global discussion to dissolve fear, shame, and blame, allowing a **new human rhythm** of connection and clarity to emerge.
* **One Shared World:** We move beyond artificial scarcity and defended borders. By harmonizing global resources, we create a world where every human is a citizen of the whole.
