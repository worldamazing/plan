# World Amazing Plan: A Global Framework
> The World Amazing Plan is a universal, open-source, decentralized framework with no ruler, where every human worldwide experiences universal well-being, where essentials are guaranteed, and where work is fulfilling and life carries a profound sense of security and joy.

## Key Highlights

   - **The End of Systemic Distortion:** A global discussion to heal our shared past and unlock our collective clarity.
   - **Radical Creative Freedom:** The time, space, and resources to build anything you can imagine.
