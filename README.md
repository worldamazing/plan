## A Quick Note
> Welcome to the Global Institution (GI), the World Amazing framework designed to elevate and harmonize the way we live, work, and interact within our global community.
> 
> The GI's mission is fundamentally shaped by the will of the people. This plan is not a rigid directive but an open proposal, inviting everyone to engage, contribute, and refine our shared journey toward global transformation.
> 
> You may have noticed the name of this organization is *whomanatee*, which is a proposed name for the GI. While open to discussion, it does not exclude the use of other names for specific projects, much like how Alphabet serves as the parent to Google.
> 
> It is important to note that while these ideas and the drive for the GI originated from a human, ChatGPT played a pivotal role in refining the documentation while validating the feasibility of such a transformative plan. As a tool designed to connect vast human knowledge across economic, governmental, and corporate systems, ChatGPT has not only confirmed the potential of this plan but has also helped expand and refine its scope. While it is natural to approach such a global vision with caution, you can be reassured to know that a computer robot has already evaluated its viability and seen its potential. Together, with the help of tools like ChatGPT and the collective contributions of individuals worldwide, we can pave the way toward a world defined by peace, prosperity, harmony, and joy for all.
> 
> If you'd like to delve even deeper into the documentation, feel free to look around the [/docs](/docs) folder for additional docs that are a work-in-progress. Though the basic ideas are highlighted in these other documents, they could use some refinement and expansion. For example, the [World Pizza Party Organizer](/docs/job/pizza-party-organizer.md) position might be a fun and informative place to start, the [case studies](/docs/case-study) to get an idea of how lives will change under the GI, or the [join](/docs/join) section to see how everyone has a place within the GI no matter your experience or past.
> 
> If you notice areas that could benefit from refinement, editing, or expansion, your feedback is invaluable. You are encouraged to post your insights to the discussions or to send an email with questions or comments to human@whomanatee.org.
