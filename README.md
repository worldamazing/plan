# World Amazing Plan: A Global Framework
> The World Amazing Plan is a universal, open-source, decentralized framework with no ruler, where every human worldwide experiences universal well-being, where essentials are guaranteed, and where work is fulfilling and life carries a profound sense of security and joy.


## Key Highlights
   - **2-Day Workweek:** From weekend to workend, with five days for life, creativity, and rest.
   - **Lifetime Essentials Covered:** Health, education, housing, utilities, and food are guaranteed rights, not monthly bills.
   - **One-Time Contribution for Lifetime Freedom:** No rent, no mortgage, no medical debt, and no taxes, ever again.
   - **True Home Ownership for All:** You’re not a tenant or a debtor. You’re a steward of your own place.
   - **A World Without Rulers:** A decentralized, transparent system where truth, not authority, guides our decisions.
   - **The End of Systemic Distortion:** A global discussion to heal our shared past and unlock our collective clarity.
   - **Radical Creative Freedom:** The time, space, and resources to build anything you can imagine.
   - **One Shared World**: No defended borders, no artificial scarcity. Just place, time, and people.
   - **A New Human Rhythm**: When fear, shame, anger, blame, and misplaced pride fall away, a united humanity can finally begin.
